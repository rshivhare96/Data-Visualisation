This project visualizes data from the AtliQ Group of hotels to uncover trends and patterns crucial for business decision-making. Using Tableau, it presents graphical representations of booking trends, revenue generation, and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the hospitality industry. The visualizations include line charts, donut charts, and treemaps to provide insights into successful and unsuccessful bookings, revenue variations across cities and properties, and the impact of booking platforms on booking outcomes. This project aims to enhance strategic decision-making and operational efficiency in the hospitality sector.
